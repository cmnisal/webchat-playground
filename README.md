# webchat-playground

A highly customized instance of web chat embedded in a web app page. This project utilizes [BotFramework-WebChat](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-webchat) and it's many features for developing the client.

This project was developed simultaneously with it's supporting bot (also built using [BotFramework](https://github/microsoft/botframework-sdk)). As is, certain functionalities won't work correctly without it.

The purpose of the bot is to demo many...most...all (maybe one day) features of Web Chat as well as of BotFramework. Other non-BotFramework services may be integrated as POC. This project is in constant development (as is the bot) as I use both for testing.

The design is purposefully eccentric to both keep it interesting and to demo what can be done.
